		<dd>Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) becomes winter caretaker at the isolated Overlook Hotel in Colorado, hoping to cure his writer's block. He settles in along with his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and his son, Danny (Danny Lloyd), who is plagued by psychic premonitions.

	<dt><u>Why I like this movie</u></dt>
		<dd>I am a big fan of horror movies, and this movie was the first horror movie that really gave me the chills. It does not have too many jumpscares that scare you, but just the atmosphere and the setting of the hotel in the snowy moutains, with no one in sight adds a sense of unease to the audience.</dd>
